**Summary:** This project, completed as part of a BS in Computer Science Semester 6 course, effectively highlighted the trends and disparities in CO2 emissions across different countries and time periods. This case study analyzes CO2 emissions in all countries from 1750 to 2022. The dataset was collected from Data.gov and includes various fields such as country, year, CO2 emissions, population in 2022, area, and more.

**Data Processing**
- **Initial Data Overview**: The dataset consists of 59,620 entries with 9 columns. Key columns include 'Country', 'Year', 'CO2 emission (Tons)', 'Population (2022)', 'Area', '% of World', and 'Density (km²)'.
- **Cleaning and Renaming**: Columns were cleaned and renamed to follow snake case convention. The '%' symbol in 'percentage_of_world' was removed, and the 'density (km²)' column was converted from strings to floats.

**Data Analysis and Visualization**
- **Global CO2 Emissions Trend**: Analysis shows a rapid increase in global CO2 emissions since 1750.
- **Top 20 CO2 Emitting Countries (2012-2022)**: The United States is identified as the largest emitter in the last decade.
- **Bottom 20 CO2 Emitting Countries (2012-2022)**: Comoros has the least CO2 emissions in the past decade.
- **Peak Emission Year**: 2020 was identified as the year with the greatest CO2 emissions.
- **CO2 Emissions in Nigeria**: A significant increase in emissions around 1960 corresponds with Nigeria's crude oil production. The trend continues to rise due to the country's status as a leading crude oil exporter.
- **Top Emitters' Contribution in 2020**: The top 5 emitting countries accounted for 57% of global CO2 emissions, produced by 26% of the world population.
- **CO2 Emission Per Capita in the USA (2020)**: Each person in the USA emitted approximately 1.2 kg of CO2 in 2020.
- **Top 5 Emitters Over Time**: The analysis includes time series data of CO2 emissions from the USA, China, Russia, Germany, and the UK. Notably, the UK's emissions have declined due to the Climate Change Act, whereas the USA, China, Russia, and Germany have seen increases.

**Achievement**: This project received an A+ grade, scoring 36 out of 50 points.
